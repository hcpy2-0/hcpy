## In Progress

## [0.4.6] - 2025-06-20
* Add Cooking.Oven.Option.SetpointTemperature as a controllable number in AutoDiscovery
* Add ZeoliteDry to discovery.yaml
* Add MIT License
* Support legacy devices with different message deviceType value

## [0.4.5]  - 2025-04-09 
* Small fix for events as sensors

## [0.4.4] - 2025-04-09
* Set cooking temps as C
* Process BaseProgram as a selectable Program
* Add an availability topic that disables controls when LocalControlActive is True
* Add config option to model events as sensors

## [0.4.3] - 2025-03-15
## What's Changed
* ActiveProgram/SelectedProgram will now display the shortened Program Name (e.g. Eco50). They should still accept UID, Short or Fully Qualified Name to control.
* Added additional Dishcare options as switches to discovery.yaml
* Instantiate a new device object when we reconnect
* Potentially dangerous entities such as Factory Reset button are disabled by default in latest discovery.yaml
* Allow named entities in set topic instead of just UID
* Replace DEVICE_NAME in discovery.yaml to allow dynamic device names
* Add Cooking Light to discovery.yaml
* Add Ambient Light to discovery.yaml - color picker will only work if the effect is CustomColor

## [0.4.0] - 2025-02-28
## Breaking

Moved to one topic per device attribute. This greatly reduces the complexity of any value_template, but does mean that manually configured entities will need to be updated. Any auto discovered entities should pickup the new settings.  

The new state topics will be in the format `/homeconnect/device_name/state/entity_name` e.g. `/homeconnect/refrigerator/state/bsh_common_status_doorstate` . The value is pushed direct to this topic with no JSON so will contained just `Closed` or `Open` in this example. 

I hope this is the last big change regarding the formatting and publishing of data as this provides a good level of coverage for most features in the device through the discovery mechanism.  Enough for me to remove my manually configured MQTT settings.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-21
## What's Changed
* Login update - remove redundant email/password arguments by @Meatballs1 in https://github.com/hcpy2-0/hcpy/pull/143
* Discovery - Naming and initValue improvements by @Meatballs1 in https://github.com/hcpy2-0/hcpy/pull/135

Breaking Changes:
This release adds a lot of functionality to the HA Discovery mechanism to create switches, buttons, numbers, select entities of controllable items, as well as the ability to select a basic ActiveProgram. This will redefine a lot of existing entities that are sensors/binary_sensors to usable types. Would suggest the use of MQTTExplorer to delete the trees under homeassistant/select/hcpy and binary_sensors to clear up old entities (although they may well still work). 

The discovery.yaml is not currently user configurable outside of the docker container, but should provide an easy way to override entity properties in the discovery to share configurations.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-31
## What's Changed
* BREAKING: Use fully qualified names for attributes by @Meatballs1 in https://github.com/hcpy2-0/hcpy/pull/109


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/hcpy2-0/hcpy/compare/v0.1.8...v0.2.0

Previously we relied on the final section of an entity (e.g. `DoorState` within `BSH.Common.Status.DoorState`) to be unique, but this is not the case across a number of devices, therefore we have changed the naming convention to use the fully qualified entity name. This will break existing MQTT configurations and change auto discovered instances, so please review all configurations.

The AutoDiscovery also made modifications to devices.json but this is no longer a very viable approach as the login process has become more complex after having CAPTCHAs introduced. 

Autodiscovery also treated many entities as binary_sensors (e.g. a door), however HomeConnect may have several different states for a door such as Open, Closed, Ajar. We treat these entities as sensor with a device_class of enum now. 

Events are no longer passed as sensors, but now will be registered as events by Autodiscovery.
